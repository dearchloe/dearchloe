Be alone.


Eat alone, take yourself on dates, sleep alone.


In the midst of this you will learn about yourself.





You will grow, you will figure out what inspires you, you will curate your own dreams, your own beliefs, your own stunning clarity, and when you do meet the person who makes your cells dance, you will be sure of it, because you are sure of yourself.
