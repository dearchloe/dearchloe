some days, you’ll oversleep and be late to class or work,


you’ll look like an absolute mess, you’ll fail your biggest exam of the year,


you’ll drop your phone in a puddle outside,


you’ll say the wrong thing at the wrong time,


you’ll lose the person you thought was the love of your life.


you’ll cry your eyes out and feel so completely hopeless because everything seems like it’s going wrong,


but even on those days,


you’ll have people that love you. and some days, that’s all that matters.





and that’s okay.
