" I don't know if I will have time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place when I started high school and you helped me. Even if you didn't know what I was talking about or known someone who's gone through it, you made me not feel alone. Because I know there are people who say "all these things don't happen". And there are people who forget what i<span class="text_exposed_show">t's like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen. I know this will all be stories someday and our pictures will become old photographs. We all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here. And I am looking at her. And she's so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. And you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear - we are infinite. "</span>
